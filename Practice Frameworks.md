# Practice Frameworks

- Solo Deliverable Attempts
- Solo Stretch Goal Attempts
- Code Review
- Paired Programming

## Solo Attempt Deliverables (30min)
- Find Sample Code
- Don’t copy using shortcuts, copy by typing
- Make it work
- On a blank notebook see if you can
  - Pseudocode all the steps
  - Recall the functions for the pseudocode
  - check your references and correct gaps
- Try the next dataset


```diff
! if at any point you don’t understand what you’re typing: 
! 1. Review documentation 
! 2. Search on Stackoverflow 
! 3.  watch a Youtube video 
! 4.  review sample code that you Googled
```
## Code Review

- (2) Roles: Submitter & Reviewer
- Submitter explains their pseudocode then the functions they used along with syntax explanation if necessary
- Switch Roles
- Discuss similarities and differences in pseudocode approach and any differences in the functions used


## Solo Stretch Goals Attempt (~variable)

- Find a blog post, article or other about how someone automated something
- Pseudocode steps 
    - Start googling the right functions
      - Resources: Documentation, Google Similar Blog posts with sample code, ChatGPT
- Store snippets and clean/format your notebook for your own reference


## Paired Programming
- (2) Roles: Driver and Observer/Navigator
- Driver Responsibilities: recall functions from memory (or be fast at Googling) and syntax
- Observer/Navigator Responsibilities: High level direction and syntax correction, can assist with Googling
